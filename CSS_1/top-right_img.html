    <h1>Butterfly</h1>
    <p>Unlike many other insects, butterflies are widely embraced and celebrated for their beauty and charisma. In addition to their cultural significance and aesthetic charm, they make a very valuable contribution to ecosystems worldwide and are important study animals for ecology, evolution, and conservation biology. All butterflies and moths are insects (Class: Insecta). Insects are the most abundant and diverse group of animals, making up over 58% of the world’s known biodiversity. They can be found living on land, in the air, and underwater – thriving almost everywhere except for the open ocean. Insects are an important part of our ecosystems, and we still have much to learn about them! Butterflies and moths belong to the insect Order Lepidoptera, which is a word that comes from the Greek words for “scale” and “wing.” This is because all the patterns and colours on the wings and bodies of butterflies and moths are made up of tiny coloured scales.</p>

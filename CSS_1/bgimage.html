    <h1 style="color: white; text-align: center;">Butterfly</h1>
    <p style="color: white; text-align: center;">Unlike many other insects, butterflies are widely embraced and celebrated for their beauty and charisma. In addition to their cultural significance and aesthetic charm, they make a very valuable contribution to ecosystems worldwide and are important study animals for ecology, evolution, and conservation biology. All butterflies and moths are insects (Class: Insecta). Insects are the most abundant and diverse group of animals, making up over 58% of the world’s known biodiversity. They can be found living on land, in the air, and underwater – thriving almost everywhere except for the open ocean. Insects are an important part of our ecosystems, and we still have much to learn about them! Butterflies and moths belong to the insect Order Lepidoptera, which is a word that comes from the Greek words for “scale” and “wing.” This is because all the patterns and colours on the wings and bodies of butterflies and moths are made up of tiny coloured scales. Along with their distinctive coiled proboscis (mouthpart) and big showy wings, these features make butterflies and moths different from all other insects. The order Lepidoptera contains an estimated 150,000 described species (mostly moths) and there are an estimated 18,000 described butterfly species found globally. The earliest known butterfly fossils date to the mid Eocene epoch, between 40–50 million years ago.All butterflies are terrestrial, meaning they live on land. Although most known species are tropical, butterflies can be found living throughout the world – from the tropics on the equator to northern regions above the arctic circle, and from sea level to mountain tops over 6000 metres tall! Butterflies can be found in nearly all types of habitat, including desert, wetlands, grassland, forest, and alpine. Some butterflies in the family Lycaenidae spend part of their lives underground! Their caterpillars are tended by ants in exchange for providing the ants with sweet honeydew.A butterfly’s habitat depends on its species. There are many species, such as the Karner Blue (Lycaeides melissa samuelis), left, that have very specific habitat requirements and can’t live anywhere else. The Karner Blue butterfly depends on a rare ecosystem called an Oak Savannah for its habitat, and since most of Ontario’s Oak Savannahs were destroyed, this species no longer lives in Ontario and is now extirpated (locally extinct) from Canada. Alternatively, butterflies such as the Cabbage White are very adaptable and can be found in many different habitats and on many different continents.Unlike human eyes, which each have one lens, each of a butterfly’s compound eyes is made up of many smaller “eyes” called ommatidia, which each have their own lens. The butterfly’s brain stitches the information from all of these tiny eyes into a picture of the world around it. Butterflies likely don’t see the crisp, clear images that we see as humans, but they make up for it in other ways! Since the ommatidia in their compound eyes are all pointed in slightly different directions, butterflies can see forwards, backwards, above and below themselves all at the same time. As well, butterfly eyes can see ultraviolet light, which humans cannot. This comes in handy, since some flowers and even other butterflies have special markings on them that can only be seen in ultraviolet light.These are attached to the underside of the thorax. Each segmented leg has 5 sections, but the 3 that are easy to see are the femur, tibia, and tarsus. Think of the femur as the “thigh”, the tibia as the “shin”, and the tarsus as the “foot”. A butterfly’s legs have the same function as our own, helping them to climb and walk. However, did you know that a butterfly’s foot also helps it to taste? Special sensors on each tarsus pick up chemicals from the surfaces they walk on, which helps the butterfly to sense tasty liquids or identify host plants for their caterpillars. This is one reason to avoid picking up butterflies when possible – the creams and chemicals we put on our hands can be hard on their feet!.A butterfly’s wings are used for flight, but also have many other functions. Patterns on the wings can help camouflage the butterfly, warn predators that a butterfly is poisonous, surprise or distract predators with flashy displays, and help a butterfly attract and communicate with other butterflies of its species. In the case of poisonous butterflies like the Monarch, the wings are also an excellent place for storing toxins (though you would have to eat them to get sick).
